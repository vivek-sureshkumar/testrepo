The reason I have been in a compendious laconic lacuna not a recapitulation, yea, It is lekker and pulchritudinous that in a lekgotla, in an imbizo, flagitious and enervating lemmatas were excogitatedly ruminated. We all saw how the recividistical politicos moved from budget disappearance to budget doctoration, now we are faced with a debilitating, exasperating, rebarbative and a humongous electricity tariff. This tariff is emanating with a financial lobotomization, and I pray it doesn’t ignite a clamorous remonstration. How dare they deplete the citizens of their obstreperous and vociferous modus vivendi, enough of this vilification and solipsism. This is execrably pugnacious, pestilential and attenuating. Imagine the imbibition of political rodomontade which has kept us in an abject ululation. Why ? NIGERIA is in a political somnambulism and malocclusion. NIGERIA is in a financial and economic bantingism…, making the game “politics” a bugaboo. What a political hurly-burly, what a political hoity-toity, what a political fuddy-duddy, what a political hocus-pocus they have come with, what a political jabberwocky a political poppycock and a political gobbledygook. with these concatenation, I ask that you accept my pertinacious circumlocution, circumambagious grandiloquence. I will not kowtow in this powwow”powwow”
